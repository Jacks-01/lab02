    <p>My name is Jack Stubblefield, I am 21 years old and have just started my journey in software development</p>

    <p>I graduated from Linn-Mar High School in 2019, then proceeded to Kirkwood Community College, where I majored in
      social work with the goal of getting my masters marriage and family therapy. I decided it wasn't what I wanted to
      do long-term so I enrolled at DeltaV to learn software development.</p>

    <p>Before I changed career fields I worked at Tanager Place as a youth service worker, then I took another job
      working as a housing case manager at Willis Dady Homeless shelter. Once I realized that social work wasn't for me,
      I accepted an internal position doing data analytics.</p>

    <p>I don't have any specific career goals yet, but I am exploring options in software development. I want more
      experience and new languages under my toolbelt before I make and long-term goals.</p>
